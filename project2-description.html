            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In today's data-driven world, understanding and leveraging employee information is crucial for optimizing
                organizational performance. This project delves into a comprehensive dataset containing detailed
                information about employees within a fictional company. By harnessing the power of SQL (Structured Query
                Language), we aim to unravel valuable insights, perform data analysis, and extract meaningful patterns
                from this rich source of employee data.</p>
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
