            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Developed at the University of Texas at El Paso, the Grad Grant System is a comprehensive solution
                designed to streamline the process of connecting researchers with appropriate funding opportunities.
                This project showcases my ability to create data-driven systems that enhance academic processes.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Personalized Funding Recommendations: Created a system to display funding opportunities for
                    researchers based on their interests and qualifications.</li>
                <li>Advanced Data Processing: Transformed and filtered data using aggregating and filtering functions to
                    improve the reporting process.</li>
                <li>Administrative Dashboard: Loaded and visualized data with a frontend interface for administrators to
                    view reports on researchers who have been granted funding.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
