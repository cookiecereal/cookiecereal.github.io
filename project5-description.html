            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In November 2023, I developed a comprehensive SQL dashboard integrated with Excel to analyze employee
                data, answer complex scenario questions, and extract valuable insights. This personal project, based in
                El Paso, TX, showcases my skills in SQL, data analysis, and dashboard creation.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>SQL-Based Analysis: Developed a robust SQL dashboard to process and analyze employee data.</li>
