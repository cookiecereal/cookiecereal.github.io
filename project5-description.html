            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The Grad Grant System is a comprehensive platform designed to connect researchers with appropriate
                funding opportunities. This system streamlines the process of finding, applying for, and managing
                research grants, catering to individual researchers, research teams, and institutions.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Personalized Funding Recommendations: Displays funding opportunities based on registered users'
                    interests.</li>
                <li>User Management: Supports researchers with detailed profiles including name, contact information,
                    email, and area of expertise.</li>
                <li>Solicitation Management: Manages funding opportunities with detailed information including name,
                    CFTA number, eligibility, and requirement documents.</li>
                <li>Application Process: Facilitates the application process for multiple grants, including checklist
                    generation.</li>
                <li>Admin Controls: Allows administrators to change a researcher's award status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <h3>User Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented user profiles with roles (e.g., researcher, team member, PI) and detailed information.
                </li>
                <li>Developed logic to enforce restrictions such as PI limitations and junior faculty-specific awards.
                </li>
                <li>Created a system to manage team compositions and apply team-specific restrictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solicitation and Proposal Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a database to store and manage solicitation details, including eligibility criteria and
                    funding limits.</li>
                <li>Implemented a proposal submission system with deadline enforcement.</li>
                <li>Developed an automated checklist generation system for applicants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient Grant Discovery: Streamlined the process of finding relevant funding opportunities for
                    researchers.</li>
                <li>Customized User Experience: Provided personalized recommendations based on user profiles and
                    interests.</li>
                <li>Streamlined Application Process: Simplified the grant application process with guided checklists and
                    deadline management.</li>
                <li>Flexible Administration: Enabled administrators to manage user statuses and oversee the grant
                    allocation process.</li>
