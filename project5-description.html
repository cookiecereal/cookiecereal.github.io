            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project utilized Python to analyze datasets for forecasting students' final grades based on alcohol
                consumption and other factors.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Collection: Gathered student information including study habits, social activities, and alcohol
                    consumption.</li>
                <li>Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the dataset to prepare for machine learning algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>Feature Selection: Identified key factors that influence academic performance.</li>
                <li>Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms including Random Forest and
                    Gradient Boosting.</li>
                <li>Model Evaluation: Used cross-validation and performance metrics to assess and fine-tune the models.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>Our analysis revealed significant correlations between alcohol consumption patterns and academic
                performance. However, other factors such as previous academic records and study time also played crucial
                roles in grade prediction.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Pandas for data manipulation</li>
                <li>Scikit-learn for machine learning models</li>
                <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Future iterations of this project could incorporate more diverse datasets and explore the impact of
                interventions on improving student performance.</p>
