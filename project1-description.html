            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Exploring the realm of academia, we're delving into how lifestyle choices impact academic performance.
                Our goal is to predict final grades based on alcohol habits, shining a light on the link between
                lifestyle and academic success. We're curious about how finding a balance in drinking might be a key to
                better grades. This investigation aims to untangle how much our academic path is influenced by alcohol,
                adding to what we know about what shapes our time in college. Using data and machine learning, we're
                hoping to wrap it up with some useful insights that highlight why making smart choices during our
                college years matters.</p>
            <p>This project utilized Python to analyze datasets for forecasting students' final grades based on alcohol
                consumption and other factors. We implemented various machine learning techniques to predict whether a
                student would pass or fail.</p>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Collection: Gathered student information including study habits, social activities, and alcohol
                    consumption.</li>
                <li>Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the dataset to prepare for machine learning algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>Feature Selection: Identified key factors that influence academic performance.</li>
                <li>Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees and
                    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).</li>
                <li>Data Analysis: Utilized pandas and NumPy for data aggregation and visualization.</li>
                <li>Model Evaluation: Used cross-validation and performance metrics to assess and fine-tune the models.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>Our analysis revealed significant correlations between alcohol consumption patterns and academic
                performance. The implemented decision tree and KNN models were used to predict the outcome (pass or
                fail) based on the analyzed factors.</p>
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python for data analysis and machine learning</li>
                <li>Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and aggregation</li>
                <li>Scikit-learn for implementing Decision Trees and KNN models</li>
                <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <p>The project culminated in a professional report that included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed analysis of the datasets</li>
                <li>Visualizations of key trends and patterns</li>
                <li>Performance metrics of the implemented machine learning models</li>
                <li>Insights on the relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Future iterations of this project could incorporate more diverse datasets, explore additional machine
                learning algorithms, and investigate the impact of interventions on improving student performance.</p>
